Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
- Java is a Pass by value, let's me give an example: 

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5;
        modify(a);
        System.out.println(a); 
    }

    public static void modify(int x) {
        x = 100; 
    }
}
=>> it will print out 5 

class Person {
    String name;
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person();
        p.name = "Tuáº¥n";
        modifyObject(p);
        System.out.println(p.name); 
    }

    public static void modifyObject(Person obj) {
        obj.name = "Bob";
    }
}
=>> it will print out Bob 

Therefore, for primitive data, Java would just passes a copy of the value to the method, and for objects, Java passes a copy of the reference to the objject, not the real object.
